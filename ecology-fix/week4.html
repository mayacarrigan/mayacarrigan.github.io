      <h2>Field Notes</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Time: 3:14pm</li>
        <li>Sunny, 40 degrees fahrenheit</li>
        <li>Understanding pigeon patterns better, how they gather where they gather and what’s most important to them (food) </li>
        <li>The birds perch by a fountain, out of season for water. This is their area as there are no benches for humans, they overtake the space looking for shelter away from the chaos of the streets. </li>
        <li>Another example of human structure providing resources for the animals we coexist with</li>
        <li>Even murals in the East Village represent the value of animals and nature in the city, featuring bright paintings of birds, rabbits, dogs, and cats. Holistic pet store nearby, as well as multiple animal shelters.</li>
        <li>You may consider this a third space that we ourselves cannot enjoy.</li>
        <li>The Union Square compost bins brought much attention to the pigeons as they fight for compost scraps. Nobody disturbs their lunch.</li>
        <li>Creating micro-ecosystems by feeding on our waste, then producing waste, and so on.</li>
        <li>Competition between different species, food dense area. </li>
        <li>Good for squirrels and pigeons, not for rats as they stay in shaded areas and won't normally come out until later. </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Reflection</h2>
      <p>I love seeing how we interpret nature within everyday life as an urban community with different values. Animals weave themselves into our everyday routines without us even realizing it, as the pigeons circle overhead in their flock at the same time every day we go to the park to enjoy our lunch. They have their own routines as well. It was interesting to see how pigeons relied on human structures as a third space for themselves, though an out of season forgotten fountain to a human, it provided shelter to them. The Union Square compost area was an entire ecosystem within itself, where we create waste and feed it to the animals, when we have historically domesticated and messed with their natural habitat. The animals then create waste, and the cycle continues as long as Wednesday comes. Rats linger nearby for scraps, though needing to be careful of the high-traffic area during the day. The East Village murals are an ode to animals themselves, as the neighborhood residents remind us who we coexist with. An article about the murals read, “It appears outside Whiskers, a holistic pet supply store, and it’s a sweet reminder of the furry and feathered New Yorkers we share the city with.” How sweet. When I had a rabbit that was alive, we used to take him to a veterinarian in this area, and he always enjoyed his time there. I illustrated the different bird species pictures above. </p>
