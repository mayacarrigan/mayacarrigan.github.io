      <h2>Field Notes</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Time: 11:29am</li>
        <li>Sunny and Cold, around 48 degrees fahrenheit </li>
        <li>Noticing how life continues to grow from expansion joints in the sidewalk, finding small spaces to push through</li>
        <li>Trying to find pigeons, I see more as I approach LPC </li>
        <li>Pigeons find shallow water sources, like puddles caused by rainfall from the night prior.</li>
        <li>Ruderal Species- specifically moss, low maintenance, requires little water and light.</li>
        <li>Noticing patterns in tree pits, who maintains them & are they for aesthetic purposes, or growth?</li>
        <li>Vines grow up tree, species hold hands</li>
        <li>Pigeons land on the top of a building while flying in circular flight.</li>
        <li>They stay in groups; you will not see many on their own. They dominate the Tompkins Square area.</li>
        <li>As I walk home, I notice more pigeons overhead perched on top of a middle school roof, in groups of 10.</li>
        <li> While not looking for food, they stay safe from any danger below.</li>

      <h2>Reflection</h2>
      <p>Patterns emerge across all the microhabitats of life, with different types of ruderal species thriving in disturbed areas. Preserving through the tiny cracks we don’t normally think about, it needs little light and water to live. Stress helps them grow, and they tend to recover quickly. Though not all ruderal species are considered invasive, many invasive species share traits with ruderal plants, such as their ability to overtake damaged or abandoned areas, rapid growth, low resource requirements, and high reproductive rates. This day I saw the most pigeons, and with one came two; you never saw one alone. They perched high up on top of buildings, on any small surface available, since there was quite a large number. In an article Ruderal Resilience, Kennedy writes about the rapid pace at which animals evolve, adjusting behavior traits like perching higher up rather than on the ground, where they may be more susceptible to danger. She also writes about how marginal spaces produce great environments for biodiversity, especially in places like tree pits, sidewalk cracks, and fence edges, where I’ve observed pigeons drinking from. She also argues that these particular green spaces, like tree pits and such help regulate heat, provide shelter for animals, and help drain rainwater. </p>
