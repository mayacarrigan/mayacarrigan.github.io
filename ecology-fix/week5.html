  <h2>Final Reflection</h2>
  <p>
    Over the past month of fieldwork, I've spent hours outdoors with the elements, noticing as the leaves 
    turn from red to brown and then disappear. Strangers looked at me curiously on the street, questioning 
    why I stopped to take a picture of every pigeon I encountered, as they ran to their office jobs, not 
    noticing the world around them. Staring at the most boring sidewalk crack, trying to understand what 
    life could emerge from it, and the countless adversities all life in New York City must face, trying 
    to survive
  </p>
  <p>
   Every microhabitat we encounter is shaped by the behaviors of both humans and nonhumans, understanding how our routines overlap and what overlooked human structures species thrive in. Sparrows, not indigenous to the US but to Europe, live best in environments similar to pigeons, and thrive in high-human activity areas due to their reliance on human waste. They were introduced as pest control specialists, only to establish themselves as an essential species within city life.

    Disturbance often creates the opportunity for new life to form, but who is it to decide certain conditions for living!? While moss slipped through the sidewalks, vines climbed up trees and grew around man-made tree pits. Pigeons bathed and drank from temporary puddles, reminding us that nature always persists and is being shaped by us but does not solely rely on us.
