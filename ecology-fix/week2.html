      <h2>Field Notes</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Time: 4:23pm</li>
        <li>Cloudy and 46 degrees</li>
        <li>I started at Tompkins square park, and slowly made my way towards La Plaza Cultural community garden.</li>
        <li>Looking for pigeon patterns, feeding patterns and flying/group patterns.</li>
        <li>Having a hard time finding pigeons in this weather, seeing many squirrels.</li>
        <li>Rats! many of them in out in the open eating nearby crumbs.</li>
        <li>2 rats next to 3 squirrels, doesn't seem to be scared of humans. Squirrels will approach if prompted.</li>
        <li>Squirrels stayed on the ground as well as traveled through branches, while rats stayed close to the ground looking for food. </li>
        <li>When threatened, rats climbed up trees to escape predators </li>
        <li>Lots of mixed species interaction, observed one pigeon </li>
        <li>All very food-motivated species, none of these animals are scared of humans and seem to be used to their prescence.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Reflection</h2>
      <p>Today, I began noticing significant behavior patterns between species in regards to feedings. Because pigeons were domesticated by humans, they thrive in active human environments. Flannery writes about pigeons being “generalists,” meaning they are able to feed and nest anywhere, prioritizing food access. Similar to pigeons, rats also rely on human waste and will forage in food-dense areas, like Tompkins! While it was a tad unusual that the rats were out in the open during the day, especially since they prefer dark areas, their behavior suggests they have become desensitized enough to humans for survival purposes. Research shows that the afternoon (the time I went) is the prime feeding time for squirrels, who happen to forage more in NYC than in other cities. (NYC Squirrel Behavior Analysis) </p>
