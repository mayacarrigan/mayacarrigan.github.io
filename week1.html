      <h2>Reflection</h2>
      <p>
        Noticing plants tucked into the quiet cracks of the sidewalk reminds us of nature's persistence. A species of ruderal plant grows from small spaces, reminding us that no matter how much we conquer, we build, we evolve, there will always be another life form that is not us. Staring into the reflection of the puddle, only to see one of its opposite forms- a tree, of old age. The gate of the community garden represents a threshold, separating the chaos of the city from the small, maintained ecosystem of the garden, reminding us that where the dogs bark, the birds don’t chirp. As rain falls, I notice a pigeon taking an eternal rest near the entrance of the gate, spending their last moments near friends and family. Starting to notice a moving system of life and our place in it.
